                A study has found that several <b>sunscreen</b> chemicals are <b>absorbed</b> into the <b>bloodstream</b> even after a single use.
                Researchers tested the absorption of six active ingredients found in four commercially available sunscreen products. Participants applied sunscreen to 75% of their bodies over four days, and scientists found that all six ingredients were absorbed into the bloodstream, and they remained in participants´ bodies for days. They also found that the concentration levels <b>exceeded</b> safety limits.
                Despite these findings, scientists still recommend to continue to use sunscreens for their recognized public health benefits. Experts say that more research is needed to understand the chemicals´ absorption into the body and what effects that absorption may have.
