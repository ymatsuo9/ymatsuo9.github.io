                A <b>humpback whale</b> with her <b>calf</b> was filmed east of Brisbane where the mother was <b>stranded</b> in shallow waters. The calf appeared to <b>nudge</b> its mother to help <b>dislodge</b> her to safety. 
                Fortunately, the whale became free after 40 minutes and could be seen swimming off with her calf.

        <h2>World’s first intestine transplant</h2>
        <p>

                A one-year-old Spanish girl named Emma became the first <b>intestine</b> transplant recipient.
                When she was just one month old, doctors diagnosed Emma with intestinal failure, and her health rapidly <b>deteriorated</b> because her intestine was too short. Emma’s disease stopped her intestine’s job to absorb the energy needed to live. The most common cause of intestinal failure in children is a short intestine.
                Emma received her new intestine, liver, stomach, <b>spleen</b>, and <b>pancreas</b> from a donor who died of heart failure in Madrid’s La Paz hospital.
                Spain is a global leader in organ transplants with over 102 performed in 2021. According to Spanish health ministry data, only the US surpasses this rate.
