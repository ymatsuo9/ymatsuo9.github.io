        <h2>People fight polio</h2>
        <p>

                Polio is a highly infectious disease caused by one of three polio virus types.
                The virus reproduces in the human <b>gastrointestinal tract</b>. Infected people spread the virus in their <b>feces</b>; therefore, the virus spreads easily in areas without good <b>sanitation</b> and hygiene.
                For years, humans have been close to <b>eradicating</b> polio; however, it’s very difficult because fewer than one in 100 infected people show signs of illness or are aware or the infection. They unintentionally give the virus to others.
                A combination of old and new challenges is <b>setting back</b> the global fight. They include the war in Ukraine, floods in Pakistan, vaccine worries, and the COVID-19 pandemic. New polio outbreaks happened in Africa, and the disease paralyzed a man in the US.
                The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has <b>pledged</b> 1.2 billion dollars to eradicate the disease, and humans hope that we will stop all polio by the end of 2023.

        <h2>Germany protests</h2>

                In response to the energy crisis, <b>tens of thousands</b> of <b>protesters</b> in six German cities took to the streets.
                The protesters <b>demanded</b> fair distribution of government funds to deal with rising energy prices and living costs and a faster transition from fossil fuels. On Friday, Germany’s <b>parliament</b> approved a 195-billion-dollar rescue package that covers a one-time monthly gas bill for <b>households</b> and small and medium-sized businesses, as well as a limit on electricity prices. According to the protesters, the government should give more support to lower and average income people.
                Although many types of support exist, the help is too <b>scattered</b>, and under the current plan, people with smaller income have higher <b>burdens</b>.
                In September, inflation in the country hit its highest level in over 25 years.

        <h2>Lego Lamborghini</h2>

                People <b>unveiled</b> q <b>life-size</b> Lego Lamborghini at the Paris Auto Show. The super car has exactly the same <b>dimensions</b> as the real one, the Lamborghini Sian FKP 37.
                The Lego car has 400,000 Lego pieces and <b>bricks</b> and 154 different types of parts. A team of 15 people worked for 9,000 hours to design and build it. The car weighs over two tons, and it’s 4.98 meters long and two meters wide.
                The Lego group’s <b>attraction to</b> the <b>automotive</b> world is ongoing. The Scandinavian giant has been producing cars for decades, and they weren’t always <b>faithful</b> to the originals.
                However, the situation changed, and Lego decided present life-size models at big car shows. In 2018, the company presented the Bugatti Chiron at the Paris Motor Show.
                45 years of Lego car history and many years of experience mean that the company can make the most detailed parts, including an engine with moving internal parts or openings.

                A <b>humpback whale</b> with her <b>calf</b> was filmed east of Brisbane where the mother was <b>stranded</b> in shallow waters. The calf appeared to <b>nudge</b> its mother to help <b>dislodge</b> her to safety. 
                Fortunately, the whale became free after 40 minutes and could be seen swimming off with her calf.

        <h2>World’s first intestine transplant</h2>

                A one-year-old Spanish girl named Emma became the first <b>intestine</b> transplant recipient.
                When she was just one month old, doctors diagnosed Emma with intestinal failure, and her health rapidly <b>deteriorated</b> because her intestine was too short. Emma’s disease stopped her intestine’s job to absorb the energy needed to live. The most common cause of intestinal failure in children is a short intestine.
                Emma received her new intestine, liver, stomach, <b>spleen</b>, and <b>pancreas</b> from a donor who died of heart failure in Madrid’s La Paz hospital.
                Spain is a global leader in organ transplants with over 102 performed in 2021. According to Spanish health ministry data, only the US surpasses this rate.
